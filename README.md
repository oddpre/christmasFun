Changes post Presentation
Santa's Mail - Odd Adrian Individual project.

Changes I did after presentation:
* Employee site, fixed the border radius, as per Harisha's suggestion.
* Fixed the obvious employees image size that posed to be a problem, as seen in the presentation.
* Made the sites completely verified in html, no errors - Big shit brig error in CSS, however, it is verified as per W3-standards.
* Adjusted the navigation bar to never overwrite the logo, as it did during the presentation.
	* Currently, it is bad in the other two pages, due to the underhoodHeader class.






// Future fixes (Will try to commit these changes before the deadline of 23:30)
* I want the logo to be in the middle
* Fix the navigation bar. (fixed)

I'll try to put in more effort by the new years :)
